## Elements of the game

### Background

The background should be a reminiscence of a forest, it should have trees or plants and it may contain a body of water. The image should not be very strong so it does not take the attention from the foreground.

### Main character

The main character is a dinosaur, it is better if it can stand on two legs, like a T-rex ðŸ¦–, so it's easier to see him running.

### Platforms

The platforms should follow the forest theme set with the background. they should be in different sizes, minimum of three sizes, so the game is more challenging for the player.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Running

The main character should be shown as he is running but he has to stay in the same position on the screen and can't move from it. There should be an animation for this action.

### Jump

The jump can be activated by a click of the mouse or by pressing the up arrow on the computer, and the character has to stay in the same position after the jump is done. The jump can't be higher than half of the screen.


### Double Jump

When the character is in the air with one jump he can perform another jump for long distances between platforms

### Fall

If the player lands in the space between platforms then the game is over immediately
